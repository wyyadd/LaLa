## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice for Linux user

- Install Steam and set up Proton.
- Have the game already installed.

LaLa currently **don't support** [Flatpak version of Steam](https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam) ([#25](https://github.com/wyyadd/LaLa/issues/25)).

## üôã FAQ
### During installation, my operating system warns about security.
LaLa Trainers Launcher is an open-source software developed using Flutter. Any security warning you encounter during installation is a false positive from your system. You can safely proceed with the installation.

### Is the trainers downloaded by LaLa Trainers Launcher safe?
Most of the trainers used by LaLa Trainers Launcher are sourced from [**Fling Trainers**](https://flingtrainer.com), and a few are from [**open-source cheat tables**](https://github.com/wyyadd/trainers) that I've collected.   
While every effort is made to ensure their safety, please use them **responsibly**, and be aware that the use of trainers can carry risks.

### Where is LaLa Trainers Launcher's cache data stored?
On Windows, the cache data is located in the ```%LOCALAPPDATA%/com.aironheart.lala``` directory.  
On Linux, it can be found in either ```$XDG_CACHE_HOME/com.aironheart.lala``` or ```~/.cache/com.aironheart.lala```.

### On Linux or Steam Deck, why some trainers won't start?
This is an issue related to .Net dependencies. Please check [this issue](https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/issues/167) for more details.   
**Temporary Solution**: [Reinstalling dotnet40](docs/reinstall_dotnet40.md).

### On Linux or Steam Deck Gaming mode, why some trainers keep flickering?
This is an issue related to wayland. Please check [this issue](https://github.com/wyyadd/LaLa/issues/6) for more details.  
**Temporary Solution**: Switch from wayland to X11 or [Enable Virtual Desktop](docs/enable_virtual_desktop.md).

### Why is it named LaLa Trainers Launcher?
It's named after my love for the movie "La La Land". I hope you can enjoy using the software.üíÉüèΩ
