## 🙋 FAQ

### During installation, my operating system warns about security.
LaLa Trainers Launcher is an open-source software developed using Flutter. Any security warning you encounter during installation is a false positive from your system. You can safely proceed with the installation.

### Is the trainers downloaded by LaLa Trainers Launcher safe?
Most of the trainers used by LaLa Trainers Launcher are sourced from [**Fling Trainers**](https://flingtrainer.com), and a few are from [**open-source cheat tables**](https://github.com/wyyadd/trainers) that I've collected. While every effort is made to ensure their safety, please use them **responsibly**, and be aware that the use of trainers can carry risks.

### Where is LaLa Trainers Launcher's cache data stored?
On Windows, the cache data is located in the ```%LOCALAPPDATA%/com.aironheart.lala``` directory.

On Linux, it can be found in either ```$XDG_CACHE_HOME/com.aironheart.lala``` or ```~/.cache/com.aironheart.lala```.

### Why is it named LaLa Trainers Launcher?
It's named after my love for the movie "La La Land." I hope you can enjoy using the software.💃🏽
